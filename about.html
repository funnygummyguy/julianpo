        <h2>The Wonderful World of Potatoes</h2>
        <p>
            Potatoes have been around for centuries, and they’ve been part of human cuisine 
            for longer than you might think. From crispy French fries to comforting mashed potatoes, 
            they are the staple of many meals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Did you know that there are over 4,000 different types of potatoes worldwide?
            Some potatoes are better for baking, others for frying, and some are perfect for boiling.
