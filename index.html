        <h2>Who Was Julian?</h2>
        <p>
            Julian wasn’t just any potato. While the other potatoes were satisfied sitting 
            in the dark cupboard, Julian wanted more. He dreamed of sunlight, of becoming 
            something meaningful — maybe fries, maybe mashed potatoes, or even a baked potato 
            with butter and herbs. He had ambition.

        <h2>The Sad Story</h2>
        <p>
            One fateful day, Julian was taken from his cozy spot. He thought his moment 
            had finally come — that he was going to fulfill his destiny.  
            But destiny had a dark sense of humor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of becoming a delicious dish, Julian was forgotten on the kitchen counter.  
            Days passed… he started growing little sprouts.  
            He wasn’t becoming a meal — he was becoming… old.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, Julian rolled off the counter and tragically met his end  
            after hitting the cold tile floor. His dreams shattered — literally.

        <h2>Julian’s Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Even though Julian never fulfilled his culinary purpose, his story lives on.  
            He reminds us to chase our dreams while we can, before life leaves us sprouting  
            on the counter.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Rest in peace, Julian Potato.</strong></p>
